Thanks for considering a PR!
Keep in mind that this project is considered finished, and thus only bugfixes will be accepted.
Also the LOC maximum on the main scripts is 100, so please try to minimize fluff.
An exception on this is bluetooth firmware, but please add only the binary and a link to the code repository.
